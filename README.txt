ubuntu-server-install
=====================

This is simple bash script that can help you run Apache server in minutes. The script includes choice to install 
"Apache Prefork (Default)" or "Apache MPM-Worker". Please note that for MPM-Worker you have to do the settings on your own.
In the future I will include this functionality as well.

Afterwards the script installs PHP, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, PostgreSQL, PHPpgadmin, Fail2ban, LFTP, Postfix.

Feel free to modify the script to satisfy your needs :)
